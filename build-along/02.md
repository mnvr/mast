Create a standalone page. [React installation
instructions](https://react.dev/learn/installation) currently point to this
[gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gaearon/0275b1e1518599bbeafcde4722e79ed1/raw/db72dcbf3384ee1708c4a07d3be79860db04bff0/example.html).
It's not meant for production, but our app is a simple single pager, so let's
see how far we can go with this.

Let's save it in a `public/` folder, this way we can just use that as the
website root when we publish the site.

The [Live Server extension for
VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
works great for hot reload.
