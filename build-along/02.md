Create a standalone page. [React installation
instructions](https://react.dev/learn/installation) currently point to this
[gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gaearon/0275b1e1518599bbeafcde4722e79ed1/raw/db72dcbf3384ee1708c4a07d3be79860db04bff0/example.html).
It's not meant for production, but our app is a simple single pager, so let's
see how far we can go with this.

Let's save it in a `public/` folder, this way we can just use that as the
website root when we publish the site.

The [Live Server extension for
VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
works great for hot reload.

Wondering how to store the prefix of the template - the part where we'll
substitute in the colors. ChatGPT says that we can have a script tag with an
arbitrary type, it'll then get ignored by the browser (as in, not processed as a
string).

[MDN docs for \<script\>
type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type)
concur:

> Any other value. The embedded content is treated as a data block and won't be
> processed by the browser... use a valid MIME type that is not a JS MIME
> type...all other attributes will be ignored.
