[Create a GitHub
Codespace](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon#github-codespaces)

This uses the information that defined in the `.devcontainer` folder within
the Mastodon repository to bring up a VM.

Building the VM takes a while. It ran into an error during post-create.sh step
somewhere, and instead created a recovery container.

Shows a web based VS Code with the mastodon source, and the error:

> This codespace is currently running in recovery mode due to a configuration
  error. Please review the creation logs, update your dev container
  configuration as needed, and run the "Rebuild Container" command to rectify.

The error seemed to be in the `rails assets:precompile` step (we can see the
full script at `.devcontainer/post-create.sh` in the VS code instance that has
opened up).

It's called precompile, let's see if the thing works without it too.

Run

```sh
$ foreman start -f Procfile.dev
foreman: command not found
```

Issue:
* Failed to setup dev env following README
  (https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/27398)
* Other similar ones...

[Docs for codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces)

It is probably not finding foreman because we're in the recovery container.
Let's comment out the `set -e` from `post-create.sh`. VS Code helpfully asks if
we want to rebuild (thank you Clippy!). It also tells us

> Rebuilding recreates your codespace. Currently cached images will be
> preserved, together with your code and any current changes. Your codespace
> will be rebuilt using your working directory's dev container.

Still fails. The princess is in another castle. The creation log shows the
following error:

```

2024-01-10 08:25:10.012Z: postCreateCommand failed with exit code 1. Skipping any further user-provided commands.

```

Bisecting, I can zero into the following line causing the error:

```sh
# Precompile assets for test
RAILS_ENV=test ./bin/rails assets:precompile
```

Since we're not going to test, commenting it out.

Continuing with the steps in the mastodon README,

```sh
foreman start -f Procfile.dev
```

VS Code helpfully tells us

> Your application running on port 3000 is available.
>
> - See all forwarded ports.
> - Open in browser
> - Make public

Mastodon README says to choose open in browser. We get a new window saying
"connecting to the forwarded port...", and nice! the new window shows the
Mastodon UI.

Finally, the last step in the README is

> On the Ports tab, right click on the “stream” row and select Port visibility →
> Public.

But for now, the browser window it opened with the preview is enough for what we
want to do (see the impact of customizing the CSS), don't need to do this.
